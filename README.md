1. using jQuery UI addon, if you import the add on script package before the main jQuery package, it will cause undefined type error.
   WIL: import package order matters!

2. using jQuery to get an empty value of the html input, its value is ""(empty string), not null
   WIL: detect empty for empty value using .val() == ""
